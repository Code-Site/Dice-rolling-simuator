Logic of my dice rolling simulator project

1. first take up a random dice from choice 
2. then print it out using multiple print statements
3. then ask the user to give a user input [y/n]
4. if yes loop it out again
5. all these stuff should be in a while loop 
6. if n in user input exit using the sys module

the images for choice random for computer 

print([                ]
[       0       ]
[                ])
